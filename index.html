          <h2>Electricity Generation</h2>
          <p> As shown on the map, the number of renewable and non-renewable power stations appears to be relatively similar, 
              particularly in Tasmania, where the majority are renewable. However, power stations with higher capacities 
              are primarily non-renewable. This indicates that, in terms of energy capacity, non-renewable sources continue to dominate.
              In terms of location, since the majority of Australia's population is concentrated near the coast, a significant number of 
              power stations are also located in coastal areas. Non-renewable power stations tend to be more flexible in their location
              compared to renewable ones. This might be the reason why nearly all power stations located inland in Western Australia are non-renewable. </p>

          <h2>Growth of Renewable Electricity</h2>
          <p>Since 2009, there has been significant growth in the share of renewable electricity. For most states and territories, 
            this trend accelerated in 2016, with the growth in renewable electricity from 2016 to 2023 doubling or even tripling 
            the increase seen between 2009 and 2016. Tasmania stands out as the most notable state, with its renewable energy 
            share nearly reached 100% in 2023. South Australia follows closely, showing remarkable growth to surpassed 70% in 2023.</p>

          <p>This graph may seem confusing, leading some to question why the share of renewable fuel consumption is much lower compared
             to the previous generation graph. It's important to clarify that the previous graph focuses on electricity generation, 
             while this one represents overall energy generation. Since electricity is only a component of total energy consumption, 
             this explains the significant difference between the two graphs' statistics. </p>
          <p>Tasmania continues to lead with the highest share of renewable energy consumption. In contrast, for most states and territories, 
            renewable energy consumption remains below 10%, with non-renewable sources-particularly gas and oil-still being the dominant fuel types. </p>

          <p>This chart allows us to break down energy consumption by sector. One key observation is that the Electricity Supply sector had the highest 
            energy consumption of all time in 2009. However, after 2014, the Transport sector overtook Electricity Supply, and the two sectors competed for the top spot 
            in the years that followed. By 2023, Transport had become the sector with the highest energy consumption. Overall, there has been a steady increase in energy 
            consumption across all sectors, with the exception of Electricity Supply, which saw a decline. Notably, the Mining sector experienced a significant surge in 
            energy consumption starting in 2015. </p>

          <h2>Energy Security</h2>
          <p>The final aspect to consider is Australia's energy security. The Energy Balance chart clearly shows that Australia is well-positioned in this aspect, 
            with no risk of energy shortages. Since around 2000, net energy exports have consistently matched or exceeded domestic consumption, and in recent years, 
            they have even doubled, further solidifying Australia's energy security. </p>
